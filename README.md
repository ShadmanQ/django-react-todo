# Todo-list-app

This project aims to create user friendly to-do list. The user will be able to add tasks, mark them as completed or uncompleted, and show a list of the tasks they have created.


This project is a adapted from [this tutorial](https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-to-do-application-using-django-and-react) by [Jordan Irabor](https://github.com/Jordanirabor). This project is being built with Python using Django and Javascript using ReactJS

Done so far:
- Initial commit
- Creation of admin site

To do:
- Set up backend in Django
- Set up frontend in React
- Create REST API for backend/frontend using Django REST Framework(DRF)



I plan on adding features such as:
- User accounts
- SMS reminders via Twilio
